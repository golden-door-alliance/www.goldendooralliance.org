            <h4>More Info</h4>

            <p id="moreInfo">
              800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children are in danger of losing their right
              to live and work lawfully in the only country they know. These people currently have some protections
              from a program called DACA, but President Trump has given Congress until March 2018 to come up with a
              permanent solution to this issue. The DREAM Act could be this solution, and would change the DACA program
              from an executive order (and therefore at the mercy of whoever is elected president) to legislation,
              making it much harder to change.
