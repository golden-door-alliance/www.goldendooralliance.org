            <h2>Your Action</h2>

            <p id="action">
              Your action is to call your senators and representative and ask them to support the DREAM Act,
              which would allow undocumented people brought to the US as children to attend college and hold work permits.
            </p>

            <p>Your Senators are:</p>

            <p><span id="senator1Name"></span>, <span id="senator1Phone"></span></p>
            <p><span id="senator2Name"></span>, <span id="senator2Phone"></span></p>

            <p>Your Representative is:</p>

            <p><span id="representativeName"></span>, <span id="representativePhone"></span></p>

            <p>When you're done with this action, be sure to reply to our text to let us know.</p>

            <h3>More info</h3>

            <p id="moreInfo">
              800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children are in danger of losing their right
              to live and work lawfully in the only country they know. These people currently have some protections
              from a program called DACA, but President Trump has given Congress until March 2018 to come up with a
              permanent solution to this issue. The DREAM Act could be this solution, and would change the DACA program
              from an executive order (and therefore at the mercy of whoever is elected president) to legislation,
              making it much harder to change.
