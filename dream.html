            <p id="moreInfo">
              Immigrants and people who care about them need our Senators to include the Dream act in any government 
              spending bill. On December 21st the Senate voted to delay voting on this yearâ€™s spending bill until January 
              19th at the latest, so we need to ensure our Senators know that we expect them to protect Dreamers NOW. 
              The spending bill is our bargaining chip and we need to make it count.
              800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children are in danger of losing their right
              to live and work lawfully in the only country they know. These people currently have some protections
              from a program called DACA, but President Trump has given Congress until March 2018 to come up with a
              permanent solution to this issue. The DREAM Act could be this solution, and would change the DACA program
              from an executive order (and therefore at the mercy of whoever is elected president) to legislation,
              making it much harder to change. We need the DREAM Act passed, and now is our best opportunity to ensure it happens.
