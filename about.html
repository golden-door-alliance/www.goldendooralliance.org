              <p><strong>Chris Kaiser-Nyman</strong> worked for several years at a nonprofit in Portland, OR that serves Portland’s immigrant community, before moving to Illinois to work on the political campaign that elected Tammy Duckworth to her first term in the US Senate. His campaign experience showed him firsthand the power everyday citizens can have when they collectively work towards a political goal.</p>

              <p><strong>Harsh Patel</strong> is a first generation immigrant from India, who sprang into political action for the first time after the current president’s immigration ban. He taught 5th and 8th grade math &amp; science in an immigrant-heavy part of South Chicago, and recently helped open a software engineering school in Mexico City for recent deportees from the US called HolaCode.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Kaiser-Nyman</strong> worked as a political field organizer in California for three years before founding a software company that helped political campaigns reach voters more effectively. He has worked with campaigns and voters from across political lines to build common ground for social goals.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">You</h2>
