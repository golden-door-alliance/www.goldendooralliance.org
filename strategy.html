              <h2 class="text-center">What are we doing?</h2>
              <p>We want to make it easy for people to make an impact on our countryâ€™s immigration policies.</p>

              <p>Many organizations already exist that lobby for immigration, provide legal assistance, create dialogue, and so much more, so we direct our energy towards the relatively untapped area of supporting pro-immigration federal candidates. Federal laws not only have a massive impact on who who can become a US citizen, but also affect the lives immigrants in the United States, and even public sentiment about immigrants in general.</p>

              <p>Besides getting the right people into office, our members ask their representatives to take pro-immigrant stands on policy issues up for vote. By making our voices heard outside of just the polling booth, we can shape immigration policy on an ongoing basis.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">Who do we support?</h2>

              <p>We focus on donating money in federal House primaries where one candidate is pro-immigration and others aren't.</p>

              <p>Primaries are the elections within a party to determine which candidate will run in the general election against the candidates of other parties. There is less money in primary elections, so our contributions have more weight.</p>

              <p>We focus on open seats where the current elected official is not running for re-election. Most re-election campaigns are very hard to beat, and for now, we're too small to have an influence in tightly contested swing seats.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">Why membership?</h2>

              <p>Small ongoing commitments have a much larger impact than one-time actions. In order for our work to be meaningful without relying solely on large-scale donors, we need this ongoing commitment from our members.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">Why be bipartisan?</h2>

              <p>Immigrants have widespread support among Americans of both political parties, and immigration bills are almost always put forward with bipartisan support from elected officials. If we're going to win in the long-run, we need solid majorities of both parties to support immigration and immigants.</p>
